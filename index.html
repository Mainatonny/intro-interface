      <h2>Service Description</h2>
      <p>This app is designed to help users quickly get help during emergency situations. Whether you experience an impact, press your power/volume buttons multiple times, or shake your phone quickly, the app detects the event and sends a push notification to nearby users. These users can then report the incident to hospitals or police, and once the reporter uploads evidence of the report, they are rewarded.</p>
      <p>The app is available as both a free and paid subscription service. Free users have options to pay for premium services or extend their subscription by earning points through promotions. Additionally, users can participate in scratch lotteries to win free prizes, and promotional partners can earn revenue based on app referrals.</p>
